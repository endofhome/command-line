grep is used to search INSIDE files. 

grep takes two parameters. 
(1) What you want to search for.
(2) What files you want to search through.

Usage:

grep <whatToSearchFor> <whatFilesToSearchThrough>

You can use a pipe to redirect output to grep. 
ie. 
find ~ -name "*.txt" -print | grep README
This command will find filenames for all text files in the Home folder but instead of printing them, all filenames will be redirected to grep. 
grep, in turn, will only print those filenames that include "README".
